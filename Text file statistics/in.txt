In most languages, some character sequences have the lexical form of an identifier but are known as keywords 
– for example, if is frequently a keyword for an if clause, but lexically is of the same form as ig or foo namely a sequence of letters. 
This overlap can be handled in various ways: these may be forbidden from being identifiers – which simplifies tokenization and parsing – 
in which case they are reserved words; 
they may both be allowed but distinguished in other ways, 
such as via stropping; or keyword sequences may be allowed as identifiers and which sense is determined from context,
which requires a context-sensitive lexer. Non-keywords may also be reserved words (forbidden as identifiers), 
particularly for forward compatibility, in case a word may become a keyword in future. In a few languages,
e.g., PL/1, the distinction is not clear. 
Just to simply test the identification:
_abc
__2_.
